# "Zoogie Projects"

# Background
I am certified PRINCE2 practitioner responsible for change management projects delivery which cover organizational, process and IT areas.
In my practice I face lack of IT tools which may save huge amount of time spent on daily project management routine tasks, documentation and so on. I tried a lot of PM software but mostly existing software focuses just on specific areas of project management activities while I always need more functionality.

Being a Python adept I made a decision to create a solution which is based on real demand from project managers, totally free and flexible so anyone may adjust it for his own needs.

# What kind of help I need
Coding is my hobby from my childhood, but I am not a professional developer. In 2016 I tryed Python and took a few internet courses on it. But still I am junior level developer and appreciate your advise or help on the following areas: VMC, interaction of model with database, UI.
