# "Zoogie Projects"

# Background 
I am certified PRINCE2 practitioner responsible for change management projects delivery which cover organizational, process and IT areas.
In my practice I face lack of IT tools which may save huge amount of time spent on daily project management routine tasks, documentation and so on. I tried a lot of PM software but mostly existing software focuses just on specific areas of project management activities while I always need more functionality.

Being a Python adept I made a decision to create a solution which is based on real demand from project managers, totally free and flexible so anyone may adjust it for his own needs.

# What kind of help I need
Coding is my hobby from my childhood, but I am not a professional developer. In 2016 I tryed Python and took a few internet courses on it. But still I am junior level developer and appreciate your advise or help on the following areas: VMC, interaction of model with database, UI.

# Zoogie concept
I see the following structure of Zoogie project:

Project Model
- represents a datamodel for all project managements concepts and artifacts. Users should be able to use it togerther with provided database or UI functionality or just separately as a starting toolkit for own python projects.

Database connectors / controllers
- represent various options to run the model with different databases, so users may reuse the Model in their projects and databases which they prefer

UI
- Zoogie provides fully pack of functionality not only to resue model in different projects but also to be used as a full pack application.
